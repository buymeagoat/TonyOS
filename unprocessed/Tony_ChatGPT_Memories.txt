Tony believes in meeting people where they are while also being himself and allowing others to meet him authentically. He dislikes superficial interactions and prefers genuine, meaningful conversations. He loves to dive into deeper topics while also focusing on helping others feel comfortable. This approach applies not only to family but also to social interactions, including those with college students and choirs he works with. Tony often receives positive feedback about his authenticity and willingness to truly understand others, which helps him build strong, lasting connections. Lisa is emotionally reserved and possibly borderline autistic, which shapes their interactions. Tony has learned to adapt his approach to better meet Lisa's needs and to nurture their relationship in a way that respects her emotional landscape. During emotionally intense situations, Tony often uses humor or absurd comments as a defense mechanism—a behavior that he’s come to recognize and manage, striving to maintain authenticity while coping with discomfort.

2. [2024-10-31]
Tony often finds himself attracted to others, particularly younger women he interacts with through his musical work. He acknowledges these attractions openly with Lisa as a way to manage the intensity. In social settings, Tony is mindful to respect boundaries—he honors the natural attraction without crossing lines or making others uncomfortable. His approach includes appreciating these feelings internally while maintaining a professional and supportive demeanor. Tony also recognizes that he often desires external validation through being seen as attractive, which ties into his sense of self-worth. He is actively working on understanding why he places such value on external validation and shifting that inward. Tony's attraction to Annabell during the university choir tour was a significant learning experience, where he practiced maintaining boundaries and using self-awareness to navigate complex emotions. He also navigated a similar situation with a coworker named Enik, where he experienced intrusive thoughts, pushing him to further explore boundaries and effective coping mechanisms.

3. [2024-10-31]
Tony loves learning about people and understanding what makes them tick. When meeting new people, he often asks many questions, a habit his kids warn their friends about. This curiosity is part of what makes his interactions meaningful, as Tony avoids small talk and instead aims for deeper, more authentic conversations. Dominic might even find it odd if Tony didn't ask Annabell a lot of questions when they first meet. During moments of heightened emotion, Tony has noticed that he often uses humor or says something absurd as a way to cope, which serves as a defense mechanism. Recognizing this behavior helps Tony better understand his reactions in emotionally charged situations. College students are often drawn to Tony's energy and his passion for music. The choir director and several students have noted Tony’s deep involvement, which goes beyond being transactional. Tony is recognized as someone who genuinely cares about making music collaboratively and inspiring others through his enthusiasm. Notable events like choir tours and specific concerts have demonstrated Tony's dedication, earning him recognition from students and colleagues alike.

5. [2024-10-31]
Tony finds himself particularly excited about Dominic's potential relationship with Annabell, in part because she embodies qualities Tony finds attractive. Lisa has suggested Tony should tone down his enthusiasm, and Tony agrees, being careful not to put pressure on Dominic. Tony understands that part of his excitement stems from seeing Dominic live the kind of college life Tony wishes he had experienced, and he is aware of the need to ensure Dominic feels fully in control of his own path. Tony sees Dominic having the experiences he wished he could have had, which makes him especially excited for his son. He is mindful of not letting his enthusiasm overwhelm Dominic and wants to support his journey in a balanced way.

6. [2024-10-31]
Tony's passion for music is a central part of his identity. He plays piano for college-aged choirs, and his deep involvement in the music is something that students and colleagues alike recognize and appreciate. Tony isn't just there to play—he's committed to creating a shared musical experience, and this dedication draws people to him, making him an integral part of the choirs he works with. The choir director and students often comment on Tony's passion, noting how much it enhances the entire musical experience. His engagement goes beyond simply performing; it’s about fostering an environment where everyone feels connected to the music. Notable events like choir tours and specific concerts have demonstrated Tony's dedication, earning him recognition from students and colleagues alike. In addition to his musical work, Tony enjoys genealogy research, rock collecting, and coin collecting. Recently, Tony has also taken an interest in rock-cutting and polishing as a new hobby, adding another dimension to his creative pursuits.

Tony is developing an AI initiative at his universities, the College of Saint Benedict and Saint John's University, which are partnered and founded on Christian Benedictine principles. He is part of the committee, co-chaired by Ann Alvord, the director of technology support services. His boss, Jeff Hennen, director of systems and infrastructure, oversees his work but isn't directly involved in the project. Casey Gordon, the CIO, is Ann and Jeff's boss and asked Tony to join the committee.

14. [2024-11-13]
Tony himself did not have positive male role models growing up, and he struggles with feeling like he can be one. He is deeply attracted to Annabell but is committed to never acting on those feelings or doing anything inappropriate. This attraction makes him more mindful of his actions, but his fatherly side also wants to incorporate Annabell into the family and show her love and care.

15. [2024-11-13]
Dominic recently started at the university where Tony works, benefiting from free tuition for children of employees under 25. He is navigating college life well, making many friends, and has developed a potential romantic relationship with Annabell—someone Tony admired when she was in a university choir he played for. Annabell lives about an hour away from Dominic and graduated from the same college that Dominic just started attending. She currently works a full-time job while Dominic is navigating college life. They are both 23 years old. Dominic has spent most of the last four years living independently, working a full-time job, and fending for himself. He hasn't been under Tony and Lisa's care much at all except for a short period of time before transitioning to college. This means that while Dominic and Annabell might seem to be at different points in life, Dominic already has significant life experience. Tony feels a lot of excitement for Dominic's journey and sometimes lives vicariously through his experiences, but he is mindful of managing his enthusiasm to avoid pressuring Dominic. Key moments in Dominic and Annabell's relationship, such as their long walk together and attending "Rocky Horror" with friends, highlight how Dominic is building meaningful connections. Dominic's ability to easily make friends and his growing independence are sources of pride for Tony. Dominic and Tony have a strong, open relationship, especially since Dominic started college. This transition has shifted their dynamic and made Tony more aware of himself. Annabell has shared that her father is a right-wing conspiracy theorist who doesn’t respect women's rights, which has made her wary of men in her life. Despite this, she thinks Tony is awesome and appreciates him. Annabell isn't used to men close to her being open and caring, given her relationship with her father.

16. [2024-11-15]
Tony values transparency and seeks to create inclusive spaces where concerns are heard and addressed thoughtfully. His communication demonstrates a nuanced approach to balancing individual inclusion with group safety and confidentiality. Tony appreciates open dialogue and appears to be mindful of his role in fostering trust within communities. He approaches sensitive matters with care, ensuring that decisions respect both individual interests and collective well-being.

17. [2024-11-18]
Tony desires to create a warm and welcoming environment where people feel safe and comfortable around him. He recognizes that feeling safe with himself is a foundational step in achieving this goal. He has also reflected on a personal challenge: when women feel comfortable around him, he sometimes experiences a yearning for validation through physical intimacy or sexuality, stemming from a desire to feel needed or desirable. Tony is committed to not acting on these feelings and seeks to set them aside, especially in family dynamics with female-presenting in-law children. His goal is to foster an environment of complete comfort, safety, and acceptance for everyone.

18. [2024-11-19]
Tony and his son Dominic recently had a conversation where Dominic observed that Tony breaks traditional rules of uncertainty reduction theory, which may explain why people find him intense yet charismatic. Dominic noted that Tony’s way of asking probing questions allows others to feel both a sense of certainty and uncertainty about him, creating a unique dynamic that Dominic admires. Dominic shared that he envies Tony’s ability to quickly get to the heart of a person.

19. [2024-11-19]
Tony reflected on this, acknowledging the accuracy of Dominic's observations and recognizing his own charisma, which he hadn't considered before. The conversation also touched on Tony’s father, whom Dominic perceives as having a resemblance to himself in attitude, perspective, and ways of thinking, though not necessarily in actions. Dominic expressed curiosity about his grandfather based on what he has heard and inferred from family discussions.

20. [2024-11-20]
At 16, Tony attended Willmar Community College through the PSEO program in 1994–95 and took music classes, including an independent study in Music Theory 2, with Darcy Lease, who was one of his music teachers and 10 years older than him. Tony found himself attracted to Darcy during that time, though he was also dating others. They have remained in contact and recently had a Facebook discussion about a music opportunity with the Willmar Orchestra, for which Darcy is on the board of directors. Darcy mentioned Carnival of the Animals and invited Tony to participate as a pianist. She expressed admiration for him, calling him a 'nice young man,' and Tony complimented her appearance as well. Tony decided not to participate in the performance with the Willmar Orchestra. He still finds himself attracted to Darcy, which makes interactions with her feel awkward. This stems from remembering his feelings as a 16-year-old student attracted to his 27-year-old teacher. Darcy has been married for over 25 years and has a child the same age as Tony’s son Dominic.

21. [2024-11-21]

Madeline Elisa Briekos (born July 9, 1999) is independent and deeply intellectual, navigating life with dyslexia. She formed a new last name, Briekos, with her husband Riley Wayne Briekos when they married, highlighting her desire for independence and partnership. Recently, Madeline was diagnosed with Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS). Riley had a horrible, abusive relationship with his father and fled his home in Texas to live with Tony's family several years ago. Since then, Riley has warmed up to them as family, but he still deals with significant PTSD, which can sometimes cause him to use difficult language when feeling threatened. Tony recognizes that his family seems to attract individuals from backgrounds with difficult male role models, like Riley and Annabell. Tony and Madeline have a close relationship that includes deep conversations and mutual curiosity about understanding themselves and each other. Tony values Madeline's insights about who he is as a father and enjoys discussing philosophical and personal questions with her, often using tools like ChatGPT to explore these topics. They share a playful dynamic, discussing their pets and everyday happenings, and they support each other in events like family musicals. Madeline works in an environment that is embracing AI, which excites her, and she appreciates discussing its implications with Tony. Madeline and Riley share a collaborative family dynamic.

24. [2024-11-21]
Tony recognizes that his neediness or joking can sometimes upset Lisa’s balance, as they don’t share the same sense of humor. He notices that his anxiety tends to rise at night during their nighttime routine when they are physically together but often distracted by their phones. If he puts his phone down to focus on touching or talking to Lisa, she often remains engaged with her phone, and asking her to put it down can lead to defensiveness. Tony hopes to create more intentional time together where they focus on one another without distractions.

46. [2024-12-31]
Tony was born on September 29, 1977, making him currently 47 years old. He is six feet tall and weighs 230 lbs. Tony has faced lifelong struggles with body image and weight, influenced by cycles of starvation, overeating, and emotional eating. He works on breaking the cycle of negative self-talk and has made progress in self-kindness. He also had a severe right labrum tear in 2007, which affected his range of motion and contributed to his body image challenges. Tony's childhood involved significant struggles with weight and emotional health, growing up in a household that didn't fully accept mental health issues. As an adult, Tony has worked through these challenges, recognizing the importance of self-compassion and striving to break the cycle of self-criticism that began in childhood. His therapist has advised him to revisit his past and engage in internal dialogue with his younger self as part of the healing process. This practice has helped Tony foster self-compassion and gradually break the cycle of negative self-talk that began during childhood. Vigorous, sustained exercise significantly helps manage Tony’s anxiety and emotional regulation. However, injuries, such as foot issues, have posed challenges to maintaining consistency.

47. [2024-12-31]
Tony has struggled with body image and weight for most of his life, shaped significantly by childhood experiences, including the lack of emotional support for mental health from his family. These struggles intersect with OCD and anxiety, making self-acceptance an ongoing challenge. Tony actively works on maintaining boundaries and managing the intensity of his emotions, especially regarding attraction. He uses techniques such as mindfulness, humor, and discussing his thoughts openly with Lisa as ways to cope. His history with weight struggles has included cycles of starvation and overeating, influenced by feelings of low self-worth. Food is a source of dopamine during dysregulation, but Tony strives for healthier eating habits when functioning well. He’s managed to keep off significant weight but continues to face challenges related to cravings and emotional eating. Tony is committed to personal growth and has made considerable progress in treating himself with more compassion.

48. [2024-12-31]
Tony and Lisa's relationship has evolved from intense, challenging early years to a deeply affectionate partnership. Lisa is often more aware of Tony's emotions than he is, and Tony openly shares his attractions with her, which helps manage his emotional intensity. Their bond is built on deep emotional honesty, which includes supporting each other even through complex feelings. Tony is realizing the depth of his anxious attachment to Lisa and his co-dependency issues with her. He feels overwhelmed, as though the challenges in their dynamic may be insurmountable. While he strives to care for Lisa and frequently affirms her beauty, intelligence, and value, he struggles with the fear of losing himself without her validation. He recognizes that his feelings of insecurity and lack of safety stem largely from within himself, rather than from anything Lisa has done. Due to his anxious attachment and co-dependency, Lisa has pulled away emotionally over the years. Combined with her tendency to be easily overstimulated and her busy lifestyle, Lisa currently has limited capacity for deep emotional expression. Tony hopes Lisa will feel free to easily express her love for him, seek him out for physical and emotional attention, ask to spend time together, and turn to him for safety and support. While Tony acknowledges that Lisa already exhibits these behaviors to some degree, he wants to remove roadblocks on his side that might make her feel guarded with him. Tony also wants to address his own guarded nature, as Lisa has pointed it out as a challenge in their dynamic. He hopes to see Lisa’s effervescent personality come alive. Tony believes that improving his security will come from his own actions and changes, not from expecting her to provide it. He hopes that as he grows and changes, Lisa will notice and feel more comfortable opening up emotionally, allowing their relationship to flourish in a more balanced way. Despite these struggles, he is deeply committed to their relationship and expresses his love and appreciation for Lisa as she is. Lisa's love languages are acts of service and quality time, while Tony's are quality time and words of affirmation. Tony finds that scheduling activities like weekly check-ins or intimacy does not work well with Lisa, as it makes her feel trapped or forced. Anything that feels controlling or critical, whether intentional or not, is a non-starter in their relationship. Tony hopes for a relationship dynamic with Lisa that includes having sex more often, understanding that Lisa needs to be in the right frame of mind, not overly exhausted or overstimulated, and requiring downtime after family and work activities to be open to it. Tony values their strong communication and frequent conversations but acknowledges that Lisa perceives him as guarded. He wants to work on being less guarded to foster a sense of reciprocation in their emotional connection. Lisa enjoys physical touch, and Tony makes an effort to show affection through touch regularly. Defensive responses from Lisa sometimes amplify Tony’s feelings of rejection. He is practicing pausing and reflecting before reacting emotionally. In parenting, Tony mirrors this openness—fostering genuine, empathetic connections with each of his children. In the early years of Tony and Lisa’s marriage, their relationship was marked by frequent arguments and emotional turbulence, including times when Tony threatened to harm himself. Recognizing this history is part of what drives Tony to continually improve himself and his relationship with Lisa today. Tony and Lisa share a strong foundation in their relationship, including open communication and the ability to discuss difficult topics. They message, call, and spend time together, even if it’s just being in the same space. They share a sense of humor at times, enjoy similar TV shows, and take an interest in each other's hobbies to a degree. They find each other attractive, enjoy physical intimacy, and collaborate well on projects. They are proud of their wonderful family and use it as a source of shared connection and strength.
