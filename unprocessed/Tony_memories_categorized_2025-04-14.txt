## 2. üíº Projects & Technical Work

- Tony is building the Whisper Transcriber from the ground up with GPT, using a design-first, iterative approach.
- The project includes a GUI and web-based interface using Flask, Whisper, and SQLite.
- He uses Jinja2 templates and vanilla JavaScript for frontend rendering.
- A simple authentication system with admin user management is planned.
- Jobs should run concurrently across users with SQL-backed metadata tracking.
- The system supports cooperative cancellation using a shared `CANCELLED[job_id]` flag.
- Logs are partitioned by type and retained by default, with optional scheduled cleanup.
- He relocated template rendering to `app/templates/` and stores data in a root-level `data/` folder.
- Tony commits changes to GitHub after each implementation step to ensure traceability.
- Users can re-run jobs on previously uploaded audio files without re-uploading.
- Tony uses `setup_env.py` to reset the development environment, deleting and recreating key folders (`data`, `logs`, `uploads`, etc.) while protecting version-controlled files.
- `setup_env.py` confirms root folder location and requires user confirmation before wiping non-tracked files.
- The interface supports multi-step transcription: upload, auto-detect language/length, configure model/output/timestamps, and optional segment selection.
- Output formats include `.txt`, `.srt`, and `.vtt`, with visible progress indicators.
- Tony is packaging the GUI version as a portable EXE with PyInstaller.
- A Windows GUI version is being built using `customtkinter` with a dropdown for Whisper models, right-click context menu support, batch file/folder input, and selectable output path.
- Output defaults to `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Whisper Transcriptions` unless otherwise specified.
- The full system runs in a virtual machine using VMware, with browser-based access for transcription jobs.
- All Whisper settings (context menu, model, output folder) can be configured from the GUI.
- The GUI should allow enabling/disabling the right-click context menu entry.
- Final version intended to be a self-contained EXE with no separate installer.
