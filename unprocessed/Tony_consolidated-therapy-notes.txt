His parents divorced when he was 3, leading to a complex upbringing with multiple stepparents and moves. Time on a dairy farm and later relocations shaped his sense of identity.

They share seven children, many with neurodivergent diagnoses (e.g., ADHD, autism, and anxiety). Tony strives to break cycles of emotional neglect, creating a safe, supportive environment for his children and maintaining open communication. His son Dominic‚Äôs recent college transition and romantic relationship with Annabell have deepened Tony‚Äôs introspection about fatherhood, boundaries, and emotional dynamics.
