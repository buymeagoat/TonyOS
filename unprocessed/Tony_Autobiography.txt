I am a strategic, emotionally intense systems thinker driven by ADHD and OCD, heavily relying on GPT as my second brain for structuring thoughts, emotional reflections, and technical designs. My deep commitment to emotional growth is evident in my continuous exploration of reactions related to rejection, attachment, and autonomy, guided significantly by my Enneagram 4w5 identity as The Individualist with a Thinker wing.

Reflecting regularly on childhood experiences of abandonment, I channel these insights into self-compassion, especially in response to historical intrusive violent and sexual OCD thoughts. I actively engage in journaling, writing, and AI-assisted reflections to enhance self-awareness and manage my mental health.

In personal interactions, authenticity and emotional transparency are foundational. My preference for meaningful, in-depth conversations shapes my interactions, prioritizing deep personal understanding over superficial exchanges. Creating safe spaces for genuine connection is essential, reflected by my StrengthsFinder themesâ€”Learner, Relator, Strategic, Ideation, and Intellection.

Physically, as of January 2025, I am 6 feet tall and weigh 235 lbs. My lifelong challenges with body image have included periods of emotional stress marked by cycles of starvation and overeating. My discomfort with my body has led to considerations of surgical interventions. Additionally, erectile dysfunction over recent years and lifelong sleep issues significantly amplify my anxiety and emotional dysregulation.

My medication regimen, as of February 2025, includes 40mg Prozac, 27mg Concerta (morning), 25mg Trazodone (night), and 10mg Buspar twice daily. Historically, medications from 1997-2005 included Zyprexa, Seroquel, diazepam, Buspar, gabapentin, and Prozac, with adjustments due to side effects and resumed Prozac in 2017.

Professionally, as a Storage and Virtualization Engineer at a liberal arts university, my role significantly intersects my personal life, especially with Dominic attending my workplace. Actively involved in AI initiatives, I embrace strategic planning, system design, and mentorship fostering an emotionally intelligent, inclusive workplace culture. My ambition includes consulting professionally on GPT solutions for large organizations (1000+ employees).

Musically, my identity as a collaborative pianist profoundly influences my emotional expression. Through university choirs, instrumental collaborations, and church services, I passionately foster meaningful musical connections beyond transactional relationships.

Married to Lisa (INFJ, 6w5) for over 25 years, our relationship has matured significantly into a resilient, transparent partnership. Openly addressing my attractions to reduce emotional tension and secrecy, I actively transition from codependency toward self-regulated emotional autonomy. Lisa's primary love languages are acts of service and quality time, while mine are quality time and words of affirmation. Our family includes seven children: Dominic (INFP, independent and navigating romantic relationships), Madeline (INTP, MCAS, deep philosophical connection), Gabriel (CPVT, supportive management of medical/intellectual challenges), Eliza (ENFP, creative), Anthony (autism), Mathias, and Vivian. We adhere to a specific naming convention for our children: six syllables total, one name starting with 'E'.

Our family dynamic frequently supports individuals from challenging backgrounds, providing emotional stability and openness around mental health discussions to break intergenerational cycles. My intentional emotional management, especially around relational boundaries with Dominic's friend Annabell, and self-awareness regarding past attraction to Darcy Lease, highlight my commitment to relational integrity and growth. Additionally, I've become a stabilizing male role model for Annabell, with careful boundary-setting due to past experiences, and also support Riley, my son-in-law, who fled an abusive situation.

Spiritually, I strategically engage with perceived religiosity while explicitly rejecting dogma, viewing Christ primarily as a radical moral teacher. My values center around authenticity, moral reflection, and meeting others genuinely.

Hobbies include genealogy, rock collecting and polishing, coin collecting, electrolysis-based metal recovery, and culinary experimentation with smoked foods and beverages. My meticulous approach to silver recovery from plated thrift items, utilizing precise electrolysis methods and detailed documentation, reflects my analytical, hands-on problem-solving nature.

I employ vigorous exercise, mindfulness, AI-assisted journaling, and reflective practices to manage anxiety, emotional dysregulation, and intrusive OCD thoughts. By reframing attraction and validation-seeking behaviors as cues for deeper self-exploration, I incrementally build tolerance for emotional discomfort, prioritizing nuance and self-responsibility in my emotional development.

Further, I actively advocate for systemic improvements in mental health resources, particularly within educational institutions, informed by my personal experiences with misdiagnoses and emotional neglect. Regular reflection on my relationship with my father continues to deepen my understanding of my identity and emotional patterns. I approach adversity proactively, viewing challenges as opportunities for personal and emotional growth, employing strategic withdrawal and vigorous exercise to stabilize emotional well-being.

Through continual reflection and structured personal practices, I strive to live authentically, foster meaningful connections, and support emotional and intellectual growth for myself and others.
