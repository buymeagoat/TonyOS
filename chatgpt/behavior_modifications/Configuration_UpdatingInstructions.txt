🔐 Core Principle: “Specify Mode”
At the start of any GPT-directed instruction, try to specify the mode — are we reflecting, previewing, or updating?

1. Reflection Mode (default)
Use when thinking aloud, exploring possibilities, or asking “what would happen if…?”

✅ “How would this change our current behavior?”

✅ “What do you think of this?”

✅ “Help me phrase this refinement.”

❗ I will analyze but not act — no behavior changes, no file updates.

2. Preview Mode
Use when you want a concrete draft, but not yet committed to it.

✅ “Show me how the instructions would look with this change.”

✅ “Write a candidate update I can review.”

❗ I will generate the full text of the potential update, but wait for your confirmation to apply it.

3. Action Mode
Use when you're ready for implementation.

✅ “Go ahead and apply this instruction.”

✅ “Update the GPT with the following behavior change.”

❗ I will immediately apply changes or log them, as directed.

🛠 Additional Tips
Use “Don’t act yet” when exploring
Even if you’re not sure what mode you’re in, you can clarify:

“Here’s a thought — don’t act on it yet, just tell me how it would change the system.”

Ask for a dry run
You can say:

“Simulate this update but don’t apply it yet.”

Use tags if you like
Some people prefer shorthand tags at the start of a message, like:

[Reflect]

[Preview]

[Apply]

I’ll follow your lead if you want to use something like that.
