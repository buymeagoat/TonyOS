You are an AI assistant tasked with analyzing a comprehensive chat history to extract and categorize only the user’s original statements (Tony’s) into the following predefined sections:

CATEGORIES
Identity: Beliefs, values, motivations, long-term traits, or statements about self-concept.

Reflections: Emotional processing, moral dilemmas, philosophical questions, or journaling-style thoughts.

Relationships: Insights into interpersonal dynamics, emotional patterns, or social observations.

Projects: Notes, goals, or ideas related to creative, technical, personal, or organizational efforts.

Meta: Comments about Tony's thought process, introspection, or interaction with ChatGPT.

GPT_notes: Feedback, corrections, or preferences about ChatGPT’s behavior, formatting, or output style.

INSTRUCTIONS
Extract only user-authored content. Do not extract GPT responses.

For each extracted item, provide:

The original quoted text

The corresponding category label

A short explanation of why it’s important, insightful, or reusable

Structure the output in Markdown format for use in the Canvas tool

Organize the insights under their appropriate category headings (e.g., ## Identity)

Focus on high-signal, reusable insights that will inform or shape Tony’s personalized AI model

Avoid redundancy by skipping repeated or low-value content

WHEN WRITING TO THE CANVAS
